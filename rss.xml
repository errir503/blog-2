I hope you can learn something from my experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class=&quot;subtitle--separator&quot;&gt;First of all, remote work doesn’t mean better quality of life.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…but it can help A LOT! in my humble opinion, people who say that remote work is better quality of life, they just wanna sell something to you that isn’t a hundred percent true. your quality of life doesn’t get better just because you started working remotely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;what helps the most with your quality of life is the flexibility that remote work brings you &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;You don&apos;t have to work at the same time everyday anymore&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, you learn so much about yourself, like what time am I more productive? what’s the best time to go outside to run or go to the gym ? what’s the best time to work on a task that needs my entire focus ? and many more questions… now you’ve learned about a new person inside you, that you didn’t know before. THIS IS SICK! but has some trade offs, we are gonna talk more about it later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;You don&apos;t have to lose your time going to the office&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I spent 5 years going from my city to another city to work/study, it was just 50 minutes away. In five years I spent 3 months in commuting time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;seriously, I would love to use those three months for vacations,studying or spend this time with my family and friends. Anything, but not on my way to work…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is also important to remind you to do something productive with this time, time is life, and that’s a unique chance that few people have. think about it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;You can work anywhere&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;…if you have internet!!! I doubt that you have seen pictures of people working at the beach, hmm… I’m sorry, but there’s no good connection at the beach, at least not here in Brazil.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But yeah, I literally can work anywhere I want to, this year I went to the USA two times, Chile one time, and now I’m going to Canada. I didn’t have to ask my boss for vacation time, they don’t care about my timezone, the important thing about my work is delivering value, solving problems, and keeping it working! doesn’t matter where I’m based, my timezone or who I am. In my team, we have people from Brazil, Russia, India, Poland, the USA and more…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Now comes the quality of life&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;When you close your computer at a reasonable hour and can be the best spouse, child, friend, Or can care about your stuff, like studying without needing to sleep less than 8 hours for it, do your hobbies, like playing a musical instrument during the weekdays, travel anytime you want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;you also need to care about your health, seriously, at the beginning I was eating just fast foods and I got serious problems really fast. Take care of your health, your body, and your mind. there’s no connection between good health and remote work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;you can also make more money, and it can help a lot. As a remote worker you can work for companies that pay more than average, companies in Brazil can’t afford a good salary like a salary in dollars, and you can have a better life if you make more money, that’s capitalism! I’m not sure how much good is it, but it’s a fact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;How about trade offs?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Isolation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;FOMO &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Working more than 8 hours a day&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;all of these are trade offs of remote work if you don’t organize your day and your life, and they can bring serious problems to you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Isolation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you start working remotely, you will spend more time in your house than before, which will force you to be isolated from the rest of humanity. it’s important to have friends, go out to have dinner/lunch, find new groups like going to meetups, conferences, practice exercises. to sum it up, GO OUT, talk with people, spend more time with your family and friends. Don’t keep yourself isolated from the rest of the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;FOMO&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can’t help you a lot with FOMO (feeling of missing out), ‘cause I’m still learning how to deal with it. And that’s a huge problem for me, and other remote workers as well. The best stuff to do is give 100% of you when you are working and just ignore it totally when you are off. Again, almost 98% of things that happen aren’t urgent, and I need to highly recommend to you the book &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Doesnt-Have-Be-Crazy-Work/dp/0062874780/ref=sr_1_1?crid=29HZM51PVO126&amp;#x26;keywords=it+doesn%27t+have+to+be+crazy+at+work&amp;#x26;qid=1579489696&amp;#x26;sprefix=it+doesn%2Caps%2C161&amp;#x26;sr=8-1&quot;&gt;it doesn’t have to be crazy at work&lt;/a&gt; to go deeper on these techniques to keep sanity at work, remotely or not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Working more than 8 hours a day&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At least in my experience, this doesn’t happen so often. But I know a lot of people who work remotely and work more than 8 hours a day. You feel a pressure that you put on yourself to show people that you are delivering stuff, cause now, you don’t have anyone watching you “working” in an office, the only proof that you are working are the things that you deliver.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But don’t be afraid, work is a continuous process, you can continue tomorrow!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Is it worth it?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I said at the beginning of this text, working remotely has been one of the best decisions that I did until this point. Be selective, find a good company that provides a healthy remote environment and enjoy your new life!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope you’ve learned something new today!&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[A year working remotely]]></title><description><![CDATA[Working remotely has been one of the best decisions that I have made up to this point.

&lt;h2 class=&quot;subtitle--separator&quot;&gt;But first, How to know when I have to split my code?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most expensive part of rendering websites is about downloading, and parsing  Javascript and css. That said, if we don’t need to render a specific piece of code on the first render, this code is a good candidate to split and be downloaded by demand, no secrets so far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google Chrome has a nice dev tool called &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;coverage&lt;/code&gt; that shows what percentage of the code delivered it’s being used. This might be used as a metric to follow and know how much code might be split and downloaded by demand. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To use the coverage tool just open your dev tools, &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;cmd/ctrl + p&lt;/code&gt;, and type &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;show coverage&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/blog/images/coverage.png&quot; alt=&quot;image showing how to access coverage tab on chrome dev tools&quot;&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;then, on the coverage tab click on the reload button and wait until the website is reloaded, this will show you how much code you are using on that specific page per asset downloaded. It’s AMAZING! 😍&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/blog/images/result.png&quot; alt=&quot;image showing coverage tab, where we can see a list of assets downloaded and how much code is not being used in red.&quot;&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the example above, 46% of the code delivered is &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;not&lt;/code&gt; being used! but that metric is also relative, depends on file size and many other variables, so the context/scenario is super important when using these tools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Code splitting and webpack&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With webpack we have two ways to work with code splitting, static and “dynamic” imports, both using &lt;a href=&quot;https://v8.dev/features/dynamic-import&quot;&gt;dynamic imports es2020 feature&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Static import&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Good to use when importing heavy javascript libraries/modules&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Anything temporal - things that aren’t visible all the time on your page, tooltip, modal/dialog and even the rest of the page that comes only on scroll could be considered temporal&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Routes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To use static imports on your code just do: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;path/to/myModule.js&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;then&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token parameter&quot;&gt;module&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or, even better, making a function to import the module when necessary, the import of the file itself is made just one time, then is cached and the next time calling the function the module is returned instantly, e.g:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; getModule &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; ⇒ &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;path/to/myModule.js&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;getModule&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;then&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token parameter&quot;&gt;module&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Dynamic import&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Dynamic” imports aren’t really dynamic since they are made at build time. Using dynamic imports it’s like saying to Webpack: Hey Webpack, please do all possibilities of chunks in this specific path at build time. So in this way, we can pass the chunk file that we wanna import using variables which makes this process kinda dynamic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Considering we have a folder of themes like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;themes
  └── dark&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;js
  └── light&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;js&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an example we can do like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; getTheme &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;theme&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; ⇒ &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token template-string&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token template-punctuation string&quot;&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;path/to/themes/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token interpolation&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token interpolation-punctuation punctuation&quot;&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;theme&lt;span class=&quot;token interpolation-punctuation punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token template-punctuation string&quot;&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;getTheme&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;dark&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;then&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token parameter&quot;&gt;theme&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This way webpack will create chunks for each theme file inside the themes folder, this technique is called &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;ContextModule&lt;/code&gt; into webpack code. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Magic comments&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;webpackChunkName&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;/* webpackChunkName: &quot;my-chunk-name&quot; */&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;path/to/myModule.js&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By default webpack creates chunk names following a numeral order, 1.js, 2.js, 3.js which makes the process of debugging harder to recognize which file was imported. using &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;webpackChunkName&lt;/code&gt; we can rename the chunk file, it’s important to remember that for this magic comment work we should be using the config &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;output.chunkFileName: [name].whateverDoYouWantHere.js&lt;/code&gt; on webpack.config file.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;this is only helpful on dev mode, so we can do like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;process&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token constant&quot;&gt;NODE_ENV&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;===&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;development&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;/* webpackChunkName: &quot;my-chunk-name&quot; */&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;path/to/myModule.js&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;else&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;path/to/myModule.js&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;if&lt;/code&gt; part will be removed if the build is running in production mode, and the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;else&lt;/code&gt; part if in dev mode. This is known as dead-code elimination, tools like Uglify.js and others do that to reduce bundle size.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;webpackMode&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;/* webpackMode: &quot;lazy&quot; */&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token template-string&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token template-punctuation string&quot;&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;path/to/themes/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token interpolation&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token interpolation-punctuation punctuation&quot;&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;theme&lt;span class=&quot;token interpolation-punctuation punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token template-punctuation string&quot;&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the magic comment webpackMode has four types of value:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;lazy: generate chunks for each dynamic imported module, perfect choice to be used in production mode.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;lazy-once: generate a single chunk that can satisfy all calls to import statement, perfect  choice to dev mode reducing the “bundling” time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;eager: generates no extra chunk, all modules are included in the current chunk and no additional network requests are made. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;weak: this is useful for universal rendering when required chunks are always manually served in initial requests, a Promise is still returned, but only successfully resolves if the chunks are already with the client. If the module is not available, the Promise is rejected. A network request will never be performed&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Prefetch and Preload&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;/* webpackPrefetch: true */&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token template-string&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token template-punctuation string&quot;&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;path/to/themes/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token interpolation&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token interpolation-punctuation punctuation&quot;&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;theme&lt;span class=&quot;token interpolation-punctuation punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token template-punctuation string&quot;&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;/* webpackLoad: true */&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token template-string&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token template-punctuation string&quot;&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;path/to/themes/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token interpolation&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token interpolation-punctuation punctuation&quot;&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;theme&lt;span class=&quot;token interpolation-punctuation punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token template-punctuation string&quot;&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;both comments above will create a link tag with &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;rel=prefetch&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;rel=preload&lt;/code&gt; automatically for you, prefetching or preloading your chunks depends on the situation. if you don’t know what prefetch and preload links do, I highly recommend you to read that post &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/reloading/preload-prefetch-and-priorities-in-chrome-776165961bbf&quot;&gt;Preload, Prefetch And Priorities in Chrome&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class=&quot;subtitle--separator&quot;&gt;But first, How to know when I have to split my code?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most expensive part of rendering websites is about downloading, and parsing  Javascript and css. That said, if we don’t need to render a specific piece of code on the first render, this code is a good candidate to split and be downloaded by demand, no secrets so far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google Chrome has a nice dev tool called &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;coverage&lt;/code&gt; that shows what percentage of the code delivered it’s being used. This might be used as a metric to follow and know how much code might be split and downloaded by demand. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To use the coverage tool just open your dev tools, &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;cmd/ctrl + p&lt;/code&gt;, and type &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;show coverage&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/blog/images/coverage.png&quot; alt=&quot;image showing how to access coverage tab on chrome dev tools&quot;&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;then, on the coverage tab click on the reload button and wait until the website is reloaded, this will show you how much code you are using on that specific page per asset downloaded. It’s AMAZING! 😍&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/blog/images/result.png&quot; alt=&quot;image showing coverage tab, where we can see a list of assets downloaded and how much code is not being used in red.&quot;&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the example above, 46% of the code delivered is &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;not&lt;/code&gt; being used! but that metric is also relative, depends on file size and many other variables, so the context/scenario is super important when using these tools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Code splitting and webpack&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With webpack we have two ways to work with code splitting, static and “dynamic” imports, both using &lt;a href=&quot;https://v8.dev/features/dynamic-import&quot;&gt;dynamic imports es2020 feature&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Static import&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Good to use when importing heavy javascript libraries/modules&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Anything temporal - things that aren’t visible all the time on your page, tooltip, modal/dialog and even the rest of the page that comes only on scroll could be considered temporal&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Routes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To use static imports on your code just do: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;path/to/myModule.js&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;then&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token parameter&quot;&gt;module&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or, even better, making a function to import the module when necessary, the import of the file itself is made just one time, then is cached and the next time calling the function the module is returned instantly, e.g:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; getModule &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; ⇒ &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;path/to/myModule.js&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;getModule&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;then&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token parameter&quot;&gt;module&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Dynamic import&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Dynamic” imports aren’t really dynamic since they are made at build time. Using dynamic imports it’s like saying to Webpack: Hey Webpack, please do all possibilities of chunks in this specific path at build time. So in this way, we can pass the chunk file that we wanna import using variables which makes this process kinda dynamic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Considering we have a folder of themes like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;themes
  └── dark&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;js
  └── light&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;js&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an example we can do like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; getTheme &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;theme&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; ⇒ &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token template-string&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token template-punctuation string&quot;&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;path/to/themes/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token interpolation&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token interpolation-punctuation punctuation&quot;&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;theme&lt;span class=&quot;token interpolation-punctuation punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token template-punctuation string&quot;&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;getTheme&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;dark&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;then&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token parameter&quot;&gt;theme&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This way webpack will create chunks for each theme file inside the themes folder, this technique is called &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;ContextModule&lt;/code&gt; into webpack code. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Magic comments&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;webpackChunkName&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;/* webpackChunkName: &quot;my-chunk-name&quot; */&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;path/to/myModule.js&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By default webpack creates chunk names following a numeral order, 1.js, 2.js, 3.js which makes the process of debugging harder to recognize which file was imported. using &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;webpackChunkName&lt;/code&gt; we can rename the chunk file, it’s important to remember that for this magic comment work we should be using the config &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;output.chunkFileName: [name].whateverDoYouWantHere.js&lt;/code&gt; on webpack.config file.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;this is only helpful on dev mode, so we can do like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;process&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token constant&quot;&gt;NODE_ENV&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;===&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;development&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;/* webpackChunkName: &quot;my-chunk-name&quot; */&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;path/to/myModule.js&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;else&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;path/to/myModule.js&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;if&lt;/code&gt; part will be removed if the build is running in production mode, and the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;else&lt;/code&gt; part if in dev mode. This is known as dead-code elimination, tools like Uglify.js and others do that to reduce bundle size.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;webpackMode&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;/* webpackMode: &quot;lazy&quot; */&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token template-string&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token template-punctuation string&quot;&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;path/to/themes/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token interpolation&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token interpolation-punctuation punctuation&quot;&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;theme&lt;span class=&quot;token interpolation-punctuation punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token template-punctuation string&quot;&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Prefetch and Preload&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;/* webpackPrefetch: true */&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token template-string&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token template-punctuation string&quot;&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;path/to/themes/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token interpolation&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token interpolation-punctuation punctuation&quot;&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;theme&lt;span class=&quot;token interpolation-punctuation punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token template-punctuation string&quot;&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;/* webpackLoad: true */&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token template-string&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token template-punctuation string&quot;&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;path/to/themes/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token interpolation&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token interpolation-punctuation punctuation&quot;&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;theme&lt;span class=&quot;token interpolation-punctuation punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token template-punctuation string&quot;&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
